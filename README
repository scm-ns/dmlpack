Deep Machine Learning Package [dmlpack]
	> header-only cpp file
	> no dependencies except -std=c++11
	> inbuilt matrix lib [ Currently in process of adding SIMD instruction and CUDA support ]
	> clean interface 
	> tons of testing


TO DO : 
	> Impelement better structure for organizing the code into seperate classes. Make an abstract class make everything inherit from it ? 
	> Add CUDA and SSE support to the matrix lib	
	> Implement covnets

testing :
	testing will be done by using catch. The user should not have to 
	worry about testing. So keep it seperate. dmlpack.h will not have 
	any dependence on testing.
