directory where all dp related things are implemented 


TO DO : 
	> Impelement better structure for organizing the code into seperate classes. Make an abstract class make everything inherit from it ? 
	> Add CUDA and SSE support to the matrix lib	
	> Implement covnets

TESTING : 
	testing will be done by using catch. The user should not have to 
	worry about testing. So keep it seperate. dmlpack.h will not have 
	any dependence on testing. It will all be code in another
