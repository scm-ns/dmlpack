I want the whole class to be a single header include class. 
	But I also want the class to be properly designed. 

Create an abstract class : Which supports the following methods : 
	train  : Either single example or a batch 
	inference  : Take in a single example and see the result 
	
Better arch  would be split up the matrix_op into multiple header only files, and the user can include the required classes

TODO : 
	Implement 
		-  axis mean	
		-  axis sum
		-  guassian rand fill	
		-  correct op* to old function
		-  add sse support
